# Quiz_mythologie_grecque

Hello !

I want to create a game that allows me to choose the correct answer between two choices. I decided to create a Question class that contains most of the code. The instances bring the necessary data to the lines of code in the Class. But I wonder how to move from one question to another without changing the question myself? Is my method correct? I want to point out that it's barely a month since I started to study JavsScript seriously, I still have a lot to understand :) Thank you in advance for your help !!
